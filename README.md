# Akatsuki_Hologram

## Objective

<img align="right" src="Akatsuki-Hologram">
So the main objective of this project is to detect dynamic object using Background Subtraction method with MOG2 algorithm under it. But to make it a little innovative we can add a static filter moving in the screen instead of just printing the masked area, therefore the target of this project would be to generate something as close to the one shown in the right in this section. This is a scene from the famous anime called **Naruto** that depicts a hologram with a static filter of the person instead of the person physically being there.
